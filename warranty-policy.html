          <ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Coverage percentage decreases each year</li>
            <li>Based on percentage of warranty term expired</li>
            <li>Example: On a 30-year warranty at year 20, coverage may be approximately 33% (10 years remaining ÷ 30 total years)</li>
            <li>Labor costs are typically not included in prorated periods (customer's responsibility)</li>
          </ul>
